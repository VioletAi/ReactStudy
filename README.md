This website is a simple exercise I made based on the React tutorial from [FreeCodeCamp]([https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-web-app-with-go-gin-and-react-cffdc473576/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-tutorial-build-a-project/)). 

The website is a todo list where users can add, check off, or delete todo items. You can see a demo of the website [here](https://qwk68q-3000.csb.app/). I have also made some reasonable modifications to the code in the tutorial.
